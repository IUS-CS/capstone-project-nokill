The No-Kill Louisville food bank is a non-profit organization that takes in pet food donations and distributes them to the community. The food bank currently uses three separate software services to track client applications, appointments, and food distribution. A single website/app is needed to streamline the process and cut down on clerical man-hours. The addition of a method allowing clients to check in remotely upon arrival is the number one request of the new system.
