# Project No-Kill  

Project No-Kill set out with the intention to create an easy-to-use website for a local non-profit to streamline their workflow while providing a remote check-in method for their customers.

The No-Kill Louisville food bank is a non-profit organization run by volunteers that receives pet food donations and distributes them to the community. The food bank currently uses paper records as well as three separate software services to track client documentation, applications, appointments, and food distribution. The Client Management System website we have created will streamline the process and cut down on clerical hours required from the volunteers. Our goal was to cut down on overhead and increase efficiency by providing a single site which meets all the clientâ€™s needs.  


## Installation  
An XML file of the site is located in doc\SRC. The site is available at: https://capstonenokill.com/ 

A new platform can be installed by creating a site on WordPress and importing the XML file to that installation.
