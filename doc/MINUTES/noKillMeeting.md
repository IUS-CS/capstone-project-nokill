# No Kill Meeting  

## Requirements:  
- Type of proof of income determines the re-up date. (For W-2 it's yearly, for disability it is variable, etc.) Admin will need to be able to adjust re-up date accordingly.  
- "No shows" will not be scheduled for an upcoming appointment until the client has contacted No Kill. (Some clients just stop showing up permanently.) Once tagged as a  
"no show", client will need to be alerted to contact No Kill for next appointment.  

## Requests:  
- All forms on current website use Google Forms, Rebecca would like to continue using Google Forms if possible. (Haven't looked into whether that is compatible with WP yet.)  
- Duplicate accounts flagged with matching animal names. (Informed Rebecca that this may be messy due to so many animals having common names. This is not a necessity, but I  
told her we can look into the feasibility.)  

## Notes:  
- Rebecca is very pleased that we will be building a new website for the food bank. She is available for meetings at other times if we need her. I gave her the breakdown of  
the data tables and explained how they will be used, she felt that the current data tables track all necessary data. The check-in method using a QR code is acceptable. She  
will email or text with any further questions/concerns/suggestions. I let her know that we are expected to have a working prototype in February.
